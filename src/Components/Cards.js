            <h3>1. FREQUENT ELECTRICAL SURGES</h3>
            <br></br>
              Electrical surges can be caused by anything from lightning
              strikes, damage to power lines, faulty appliances and bad
              electrical wiring in the house. While an actual surge only lasts a
              microsecond, frequent surges can damage the electrical components
              connected to your home, degrading their life expectancy
              significantly. If you experience frequent electrical surges, the
              culprit is probably an electrical device connected to the home
              grid or the wiring itself. Try removing any cheaply made devices
              or powerboards from the outlet to see if this prevents the surges.
              Otherwise, it might be time to consult a professional electrician.
